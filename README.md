Front End for e-commerce website "Outlet de Mates"

After finishing my Full Stack Developer studies at Digital House I was excited about giving my first steps as a web developer, so I contacted an instagram entepreneur, Nicolas, and I proposed him to develop an e-commerce for his business.

After getting in touch with Nicolas' commercial needs, I started this project with the back-end service, prior to developing the front-end service, hosted in this repository. This service has the following functionalities:

- API consumption with Axios/Fetch
- Routing with react-router
- Stying with Tailwind.css
- Home, product categories, product sales and product details pages
- Admin dashboard with CRUD for products and user administration (add, delete, edit)

EXTRA LIBRARIES
- Tailwind CSS


Back-end repository is hosted on https://github.com/mlabato/odmexpress:
